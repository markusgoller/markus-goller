# What is the Pflanzen App Tirol?
It is a quiz app which has the benefit to give people again an awareness for the flora of Tyrol.
It was initiated by Joseph Molyneux and his team.
The app is available at the [Google Playstore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gurk.botanikapp&gl=AT), and was supported by the Land Tirol, Di√∂zese Innsbruck and the Austrian Biologists Association.

## What did I do:
I did the homepage with the help of the static site generator [Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/), powered by python.

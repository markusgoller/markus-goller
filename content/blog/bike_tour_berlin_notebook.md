# Bike tour Berlin 2020 (updated 2024)
Since my brother and I belong more to the sporty guys, we thought, why shouldn't we explore Berlin during our four-day stay by bike.
So we grabbed a rental bike and went for a spin through Berlin.

All in all we were really quite sporty and cycled a good 100 kilometers across Berlin, within 4 days. Here are a few impressions from Berlin:

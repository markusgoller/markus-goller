# Bike tour Berlin
Since my brother and I belong more to the sporty guys, we thought, why shouldn't we explore Berlin by bike.
So we grabbed a rental bike and went for a spin through Berlin.

### Finally a map constructed in [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) and [Google Colab](https://colab.google/)  via [Folium](https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/latest/)

All in all we were really quite sporty and cycled a good 100 kilometers across Berlin, here are a few impressions from Berlin,
